# The Ploopy Trackball

By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Trackball. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Trackball. We've also included some kick-ass documentation in the Wiki on how to get it made, assemble it, and program it.

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.


This fork modifies the actions associated with the buttons, which I don't find particularly useful at their defaults:

button 1 (mouse left) -> *unchanged*

button 2 (mouse right) -> keyboard backspace

button 3 (mouse middle) -> *unchanged*

button 4 (mouse back) -> mouse right

button 5 (mouse forward) -> keyboard return
